# Marketplace

Welcome to my Marketplace repository! This project was made to help me learn the basics of Django by building a simple online marketplace where people can buy and sell items.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication.
- **Search**: Easily search for items by their name or category.
- **Dashboard**: Displays each available item on the marketplace. 
- **Communication**: Allow users to communicate with each other.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. To run the application write into the console `python manage.py runserver`.
